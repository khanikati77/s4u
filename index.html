                    These observations have played a significant role in establishing the standard model of cosmology.

                    from the University of Pittsburgh studying how the rat integrates information from multiple facial 
                    whiskers using physiological and computational techniques. In his laboratory he utilizes physiological

                    and function of cortical circuits. Dr. Brumberg has published over 60 peer-reviewed articles 
                    and has received multiple grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of
                    Health. Currently, his research focuses on how sensory experience shapes the development of cortical circuits. 
                    In addition to his scholarly work Dr. Brumberg has served several administrative functions within CUNY, 
                    including directing their doctoral training in Psychology and is presently the Dean for the Sciences at

                    Small received her PhD in the Biological Sciences in 1983 from Wolverhampton Polytechnic. She moved to
                     the US in 1985 to conduct postdoctoral research at the Rockefeller University in New York, 
                     in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Christian DeDuve, a cytologist and biochemist. 
                    <br>    
                    Previously, Small served on the faculty at the University of Florida (1988), where 
                    she led her own independent research program to study peroxisome biogenesis and the 
                    molecular regulation of lipid metabolism. In 1992, she became a faculty member at 
                    Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. 
                    <br>
                    At CUNY, Small was instrumental in redesigning doctoral education in the sciences and in enhancing the 
                    University’s scientific research infrastructure. She established CUNY’s first Postdoctoral 
                    Program for postdoctoral fellows across the University and the Technology Commercialization office.
                     She also played a key role in establishing several new research institutes, and both envisioned 
                     and developed a new CUNY Advanced Science Research Center.

                    Phytoplankton, microscopic organisms that form the base of aquatic food webs, generate approximately 
                    half of the world’s oxygen through photosynthesis and thus exert considerable influence over nutrient 
                    and carbon cycling.

                    physiology, and biogeochemistry. This includes but is not limited to understanding the causes and consequences 
                    of ‘harmful algal blooms’ (HABs), events produced by a subset of phytoplankton 
                    species that result in negative ecological and/or health impacts when populations become

                    We probe our environment and communicate with one another with classical waves. Because of wave-particle 
                    duality, studies of classical waves also serve as models of electronic transport, involving quantum mechanical
                     electron waves in the solid state. The goal of our studies of microwave and optical propagation is to provide
                    a universal description of wave propagation in random systems and to apply the understanding gained to imaging
                    and communications. We explore the diversity of propagation phenomena in ensembles of sample realizations 
                    which reflect the openness, scattering strength, internal reflection, dissipation or gain, and topology of the system.
